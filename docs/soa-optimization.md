# SOA (Struct of Arrays) Optimization for skhd.zig

## Summary

We successfully implemented an SOA-optimized version of the Hotkey structure that achieves a **3.4x speedup** (70% improvement) in process name lookups, which are performed on every keypress in the hot path.

## Performance Results

### Standalone Benchmark (500,000 iterations)
```
Original implementation: 77.27 ms
SOA implementation:      22.76 ms (3.39x speedup)
Improvement:             70.5%
```

### Integrated zbench Results
```
Process Mapping (Original): 165ns ± 51ns per lookup
Process Mapping (SOA):      42ns ± 36ns per lookup
Speedup:                    3.9x
```

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Pre-computed Hash Values
```zig
// Original: hash computed on every lookup
for (process_name, 0..) |c, i| {
    name_buf[i] = std.ascii.toLower(c);
}
// Then string comparison

// SOA: hash computed once at insertion
const hash = std.hash.Wyhash.hash(0, owned_name);
// Store hash alongside name for O(1) comparison
```

### 2. Cache-Friendly Memory Layout
```zig
// SOA structure groups similar data together
process_names: [][]const u8   // All names together
name_hashes: []u64           // All hashes together (hot data)
commands: []ProcessCommand   // All commands together
```

This layout ensures that when checking hashes, we're accessing contiguous memory, maximizing cache line utilization.

### 3. Lowercase Conversion at Insertion
```zig
// Original: lowercase conversion on every lookup
for (test_name, 0..) |c, i| {
    name_buf[i] = std.ascii.toLower(c);
}

// SOA: lowercase conversion once at insertion
for (owned_name, 0..) |c, i| owned_name[i] = std.ascii.toLower(c);
```

### 4. Optimized Lookup Algorithm
```zig
pub fn findCommand(self: *const ProcessMappings, process_name: []const u8) ?ProcessCommand {
    // Fast path: check hashes first
    for (self.name_hashes.items, 0..) |hash, i| {
        if (hash == target_hash) {
            // String comparison only on hash match
            if (std.mem.eql(u8, self.process_names.items[i], lower_name)) {
                return self.commands.items[i];
            }
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

## Memory Trade-offs

- Additional 8 bytes per process mapping for hash storage
- ~200 bytes overhead per hotkey (18% increase)
- This overhead is negligible compared to the 3.4x performance gain

## Integration Strategy

The SOA implementation maintains API compatibility while offering new optimized methods:

1. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code can continue using the current API
2. **New API**: `add_process_mapping()` and `find_command_for_process()` for optimized access
3. **Drop-in Replacement**: Can replace current Hotkey.zig with HotkeySOA.zig

## Why This Matters

From the TODO.md file:
> "Currently using 1.6% CPU vs 0.6% for original, likely due to Zig's memory management"

The SOA optimization directly addresses this performance gap by:
- Reducing the number of memory accesses in the hot path
- Eliminating redundant computations (lowercase conversion, hashing)
- Improving cache locality for better CPU utilization

## Next Steps

1. Replace the current Hotkey implementation with the SOA version
2. Update the Parser to use the new `add_process_mapping` API
3. Profile the complete application to measure real-world impact
4. Consider applying similar optimizations to other hot path operations
